# HGCal Raw Data Processing and SimHit Producer

This repository contains the development and validation steps for handling raw data of the High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCal) detector in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment.

## Overview

Processing raw data for the HGCal detector involves converting Raw Hits (SimHits) into `pCaloHits` and validating detector identifiers (DetIDs) against HGCal geometry. The key steps in this workflow ensure accurate data handling, visualization, and preparation for further analysis.

## 1. Set Up the CMSSW Environment
First, ensure you are using the correct CMSSW version. Set up the environment as follows:

```
# Load the CMSSW version
cd /path/to/your/working/directory
cmsrel CMSSW_14_1_0_pre2
cd CMSSW_14_1_0_pre2/src
cmsenv
### 2.
```bash
git cms-addpkg Geometry/CMSCommonData
git cms-addpkg Configuration/Geometry
git cms-addpkg Geometry/HGCalCommonData
git cms-addpkg Geometry/HGCalGeometry
git cms-addpkg Geometry/Records

git clone https://github.com/Bharat0014/HGCalDetIDvalidation.git
scram b -j 8
cd HGCalDetIDvalidation/python
cmsRun HGCalRawDattest_cfi.py
```
## Features

### 1. Development of SimHit Producer
A specialized producer was implemented to:
- Process raw SimHit data.
- Convert RawHits(DetIds) into `pCaloHits`.
- Store intermediate results in `step1.root` for validation and subsequent processing.

### 2. Validation of DetID
To ensure consistency with HGCal geometry, two key issues were addressed:
- **Layer Number Validation**: Confirming that DetIDs correspond to the correct detector layers.
- **Radius (R) Calculation of Layers**: Using `DDDConstant` to validate radial positions of layers, ensuring alignment with HGCal geometry.

Additionally, validation was extended to **subgroups based on wafer types**, distinguishing between:
- Full wafers.
- Partial wafers.

This approach ensures precise representation of HGCal segmentation.

### 3. Multi-Step Processing Pipeline
The raw data processing involves the following steps:
1. **`step1.root`**: Generated by the SimHit producer, serving as the initial processed output.
2. **`step2.root`**: Produced using `step1.root` as input, incorporating additional validations and refined processing.
3. **`step3.root`**: Final output generated using `step2.root` for extended validation and analysis.

### 4. Visualization with Fireworks
The Fireworks visualization tool was configured to:
- Display raw DetIDs interactively.
- Enable visual verification of the processed data.
